# Final Project Proposal

## Light Painting + Shadow Art + Animation

### Summary:

- I am thinking to make kits that somewhat like miniPOV or AniPOV, and combinde them with a cycling short animation.
- The animation will be a easy run cycle.
 - to make the animation smoother, will have at least 3 pieces of kit on a wheel.
- I want to make it a little bit interative, which turns the potentiometer the running character will turns.
  - or
  - the animation will zoom in or zoom out
   - at this point this animation will be cat chasing a mice.
- I think I will just make it single-color.

- I also think about to make it 3D, which will at least have 5 wheels connect together, but I think the time will not be enough for me to code.  And I worries the lights of each layers will affect the shpes in each layer (will the front layer covers the next layer?)
- And
- automatically turns on when spin. (which will need a sensor?)

### Component Parts:

- at least 3 pieces of PCB (probably protoboard)
 - ~8'' long
- LEDs
- Resistors
- wires
- Zender Diodes
- ceramic capacitor
- Microcontroller
- USB Jack
- switches
- Battery Holders

* parts I might need but not sure what are they for
- Hall Sensor
- General Purpose Transistor
- Male Header
- 100uF/6V Capacitor

- Ole bicycle wheel
- wheel holder

* Buy
* I hope I can build a wheel holder but it requiers the technique that I don't…… and the time is a hitman.
 * still thinking a new way to replace the wheel holder.
  * wood boards whith bears?

### Challenges
- coding
- A lot of electronic parts that I don't know
- building the kit requires neat hands, neat head, and attantion.

### Project Timeline
1. Code the prototype
2. build up the kits
3. put it on the wheels
4. make sure the wheels can spin
5. finish the final code!
